Just be aware:

    Some advanced Nextcloud features or apps may not work out-of-the-box.
    If you hit a “not supported on LXC” warning in Nextcloud, it’s not a bug in your setup.
    For production or business-critical use, prefer a VM or follow Nextcloud’s support recommendations.

Summary:

    Official = VM for broadest compatibility and support.
    LXC = lightweight, works for many, but “DIY” and not officially supported.
    No template exists because of the above, but your approach is valid for many use cases!
